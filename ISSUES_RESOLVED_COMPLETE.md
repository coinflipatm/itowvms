# iTow VMS Issues Resolution - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary of Issues Resolved

All reported issues with the iTow Vehicle Management System have been successfully resolved:

### 1. ✅ Vehicles Not Appearing in Frontend After Scraping
**Issue**: Scraped vehicles were not visible in the frontend active vehicles tab despite being in the database.

**Root Cause**: 66 vehicles had `archived=1` when they should have had `archived=0` for active statuses.

**Solution**: 
- Created and executed `fix_archived_field.py` script
- Corrected archived field for all vehicles based on their status
- Active statuses (New, TOP Generated, TR52 Ready, etc.) now have `archived=0`
- Completed statuses (Released, Auctioned, Scrapped) have `archived=1`

**Result**: All 66 active vehicles now appear correctly in the frontend.

### 2. ✅ Vehicle Status Categorization Working
**Issue**: Vehicles not appearing in correct status categories (active vs completed).

**Root Cause**: Same as issue #1 - incorrect archived field values.

**Solution**: Fixed by the archived field correction.

**Result**: Status filtering now works correctly:
- Active tab shows 66 vehicles with active statuses
- Completed tab shows 0 vehicles (none currently completed)
- Proper categorization between active and completed vehicles

### 3. ✅ Date Display Issue Fixed
**Issue**: Tow dates displayed one day earlier than the actual date set in vehicle details.

**Root Cause**: JavaScript `new Date()` constructor treating YYYY-MM-DD strings as UTC midnight, causing timezone shift when converting to local time for display.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `formatDateForDisplay()` function in `/static/js/main.js`
- Added specific handling for YYYY-MM-DD format to create Date objects in local timezone
- Modified `calculateDaysInLot()` function to use the same fix

**Result**: Dates now display correctly without timezone-related shifts.

## Technical Details
